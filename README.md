# Challenge 8 and 11
## UrbanTreeHealthAndSafety
Monitoring trees' health status by combining data from in-situ IoT devices and EO satellites


**Guidelines:**

1.Data
We have two source that collect two type of data. The objectif here is to match the sources.

Source 1:
In SITU DATA :
   a. AQP (air quality)
   b. HTP (helath trees)
   
Source2:
Satellite DATA :
  a. S2 (helath trees)
  b. S3 (air quality)
  c. S5P (air quality)
  d. HR Optical (not yet)

2. Make the super resolution
3. Single analyse tree

=======
Steps to do:
- reproduce the super resolution algoritms to mak ethem work on sentinel 2, 3 and 5p
- assemble and make the Health Tree Platform (HTP) working
- acquire
